As shown in Equation, Euler's identity is a fundamental mathematical relationship.
## REGNAME
This is markdown. Consider: 
$$
E = mc^2
$$ {#eq-einstein}

Where Equation @eq-einstein demonstrates the relationship between energy, mass, and the speed of light.

````julia
m = 1

c = 3e8

E = m*c^2
````

Another multiline equation is as follows: 

$$
\begin{align}
  Ax &= b \\
  x &\ge 0
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-Ax-eq-b}
Here, Equation @eq-Ax-eq-b represents a system of linear equations with non-negativity constraints.

As shown in Equation, Euler's identity is a fundamental mathematical relationship.
## Einstein's Equation `E=m c^2`
This is markdown. Consider: 
$$
E = mc^2
$$ {#eq-einstein}

Where Equation @eq-einstein demonstrates the relationship between energy `e`, mass `m`, and the speed of light `c`.

````julia
m = 1

c = 3e8

E = m*c^2
````

Another multiline equation is as follows: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
  Ax &= b \\
  x &\ge 0
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-Ax-eq-b}
Here, Equation @eq-Ax-eq-b represents a system of linear equations with non-negativity constraints.

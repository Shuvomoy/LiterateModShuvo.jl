As shown in Equation, Euler's identity is a fundamental mathematical relationship.
## Einstein's Equation `E=m c^2`
This is markdown. Consider: 
$$
E = mc^2
$$ {#eq-einstein}

Where Equation @eq-einstein demonstrates the relationship between energy `e`, mass `m`, and the speed of light `c`.

````julia
m = 1

c = 3e8

E = m*c^2
````

Another multiline equation is as follows: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
  Ax &= b \\
  x &\ge 0
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-Ax-eq-b}
Here, Equation @eq-Ax-eq-b represents a system of linear equations with non-negativity constraints.

Here is a table:

| Algorithm | \(f(x^*)\) | Time (s) |
|:---------:|------------:|---------:|
| PDHG      |       1.234 |     0.07 |
| B&B       |       1.230 |     3.12 |

Another table: 


| Field | Type | Mathematics | Implementation detail | Role in the package |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `_id` | `Int` | Pure identifier; no direct math meaning | Incremented from global `NEXT_ID[]` | Stable identity for hashing, comparisons, dictionary keys |
| `_is_leaf` | `Bool` | Indicates whether this is a fundamental vector in the Gram basis | `true` for leaf points, `false` for linear combinations | Determines Gram dimensioning and whether `.counter` is set |
| `decomposition_dict` | `OrderedDict{Point,Float64}` | Stores coefficients of the linear form $X=\sum_i \alpha_i P_i$ | For a leaf, set to `{self => 1.0}`; for a composite, the sparse coefficient map | Drives conversion of inner products to linear forms over G |
| `counter` | `Union{Int,Nothing}` | Index i of the leaf in the Gram basis (only for leaves) | Set to `Point_counter[]` at leaf creation, `nothing` otherwise | Used to size/index the Gram matrix and build evaluation vectors |
| `_value` | `Union{Vector{Float64},Nothing}` | Numerical value of the vector after solving the PEP | `nothing` until `solve!` writes results back | Enables `eval` to return a concrete vector after solve |
